    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are advantageous in programs because they offer reusability, modularity, and abstraction. They allow you to write code once and use it multiple times, break down complex programs into smaller manageable parts, and hide implementation details. Functions also improve code readability, organization, and maintainability, making it easier to test and debug your code."

On the other hand, local scopes are created whenever a function or method is called. Each function call or method invocation establishes its own local scope, which is separate and independent.
