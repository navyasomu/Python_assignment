    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to structure software to mimic real-world entities and their interactions effectively. OOP achieves this through key principles:\n",

    "-->Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods into objects for data integrity and reduced complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by creating abstract templates (classes) for objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Inheritance: Promoting code reuse by allowing classes to inherit properties and behaviors from others.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, enhancing code flexibility.\n",

    "In Python, an object is a self-contained unit that represents a real-world entity or concept, and it combines data (attributes) with the methods (functions) that operate on that data. Objects are instances of classes and can be used to model and interact with various elements in a program, making Python an object-oriented programming language.\n",
