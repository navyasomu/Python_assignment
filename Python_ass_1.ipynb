    "Float: A float is a data type used to represent numbers with a fractional part. It is used for storing real numbers, including          decimal values. Floats allow for precise calculations involving non-integer values in various mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "List: A list is a data type used to store a collection of items. It can hold elements of different data types and allows for           dynamic resizing. Lists are versatile and provide functionalities like appending, accessing, and modifying elements,             making them valuable for organizing and manipulating data in a flexible manner.\n",
